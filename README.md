Synaptweak
aka My Synaptics Touchpad Config App for Linux

DESCRIPTION

This program lets me tweak and play with the pressure sensitivity 
settings on my laptop's Synaptics Trackpad, to try to find the sweet
spot to avoid triggering accidental clicks. It also changes some other
settings in the driver. It has a graphical interface.

This is configured for my hardware. I make NO guarantee that this
will work with your machine.

REQUIREMENTS

This uses pyqt5.

This also uses "xinput" and "synclient." You should have xinput already,
but you might need to install "synclient" - check your repos
